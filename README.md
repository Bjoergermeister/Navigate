# Navigate

A small console application which makes navigation through the terminal easier.

## About this project

I was getting tired of writing long cd commands when navigation to a specific projects directory in the terminal, so I wanted to create a little application which speeds up this process.
Navigate allows you to map a name to a specific path on your system so that whenever you want to navigate to that path, you provide the name to the application and it navigates to the mapped path.
